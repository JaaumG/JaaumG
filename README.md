 I'm currently working on desktop based application to help attorney offices to handle more easily administration questions, such as client control, financial spends, documents control and organization, and on another desktop based application to help therapists to organize its agenda both in java.
 
I'm currently learning by myself and from some classes, Python, CSS, C, Java, *(which by the way, its my favourite)*. And pretend to learn as well, HTML, JavaScript, C#, C++ Flutter and/or React.
